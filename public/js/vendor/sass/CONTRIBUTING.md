# How To Contribute

Sass.js is a convenience API for libsass.js which is emscripted from [libsass](http://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/). That means that the issues pertaining to parsing SCSS are *not* scope of Sass.js. They need to be reported in the [libsass](http://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/) repository.

In other words, if you can reproduce your issue with either [node-sass](http://github.com/andrew/node-sass) or [sassc](http://github.com/hcatlin/sassc/) please report your problems the [libsass](http://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/) repository.
